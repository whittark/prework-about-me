      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a technical writer currently working in the medical software industry. In the past four years, I've been developing communication solutions and am excited to deepen my somewhat patchy knowledge base. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Knoxville, TN, but started second grade in Kirkland, WA. I work in downtown Seattle.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy writing and painting; all things creative. Now I want to learn how to use coding as a medium.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to design and build better ways to communicate software solutions to end users; but I'd <i>really</i> like to create a new kind of space where technology and humans meet that's friendlier for people. Not just a bunch of UI forms. A living room. A marbled terrace. The workspace could be fun; could be peaceful; could be gameified for the innately competitive. Anything but boxes within boxes. But I have to learn about the boxes first. :-) </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a duplex in West Seattle with my dog, Cosmo.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because this is the space where people and technology intersect; I want build something that inspires joy here.</p>
